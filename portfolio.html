        <h3>Here you can see my working experience</h3>
        <p>When I turned 16 I became more and more interested in programming and crypto, and in some point I even got a belif that combination of these to things really can change the world<p>
        <p>When I was 17 I joined <a href="https://near.org/" style="color: #82a1db;">Near</a> as a junior python developer and "project-manager", I've been there for only 2 months, but back then it was really powerfull experience, that thought me how to work in more or less "big" organisations<p>
        <p>By the age of 19 I gave up on my crypto dreams,and thought that I can do something in so-called "real world" and this is why I became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment" style="color: #82a1db;">Recruiter</a> in an <a href="https://svx.aero/en/" style="color: #82a1db;">airoport</a> in my hometown. There I met some cool and at the same time strange people, but also learned a lot about how to work with others</p>
