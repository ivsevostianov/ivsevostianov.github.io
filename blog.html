            <p class="post-meta">Posted on September 15, 2023</p>
            <p>Overall, in my opinion teachers are nice and always willing to help, and the programm itself is quite entertaining and you learn a lot of new stuff right from the beggining</p>

            <h2>Why I chose HZ University</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Posted on September 13, 2023</p>
            <p>When I first visited Netherlands in 2018 as a turist, I immideatelly fall in love with this country, and I 
                was dreaming about getting my bachelor here since then. As for University itself I really liked the programm and 
                the atmosphere there, all the guys that spoke to me were very nice and friendly and I literally couldn't resist anymore
